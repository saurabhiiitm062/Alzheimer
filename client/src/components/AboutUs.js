            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>Our project is driven by a simple yet powerful truth: Alzheimer's disease touches lives deeply, gradually dimming cherished memories and posing profound challenges to personal identity and connection. Witnessing the devastating effects of this disease firsthand, we recognized an urgent need for early detection and proactive intervention. With a deep-seated commitment to making a difference, we set out to develop an innovative solution that harnesses the power of speech for early Alzheimer's detection. Our mission is to empower individuals and families with accessible tools for proactive cognitive health monitoring, ultimately improving outcomes and enhancing quality of life.</p>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our mission at CogniCare is clear: to empower individuals and caregivers with accessible, non-invasive tools for early Alzheimer's detection. We are committed to leveraging innovative technology to detect subtle changes in speech patterns, providing timely insights that enable proactive interventions and improved outcomes. Through our platform, we strive to raise awareness, promote early intervention, and ultimately, enhance the quality of life for those affected by Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        
            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            <p>We envision a future where Alzheimer's disease is detected early, managed effectively, and ultimately, conquered. We aspire to create a world where individuals have the power to monitor their cognitive health with ease and confidence, enabling them to take control of their well-being and live life to the fullest. With our vision guiding us, we remain dedicated to advancing the field of Alzheimer's detection, fostering a community of support and empowerment, and driving positive change in the fight against this devastating disease.</p>
